    <p>
      I'm a software engineer with more than 4 years of experience in the development field. 60% of my lifetime has been dedicated to programming since I was 10 years old, I got interested in how people built websites, so I started creating pages through templates such as blogspot and wix. Then, some years later I started college, where I got my first job as full-stack developer while I was in my fourth semester and then I continued my career studying and working. Last year I finished college, but I’d like to continue studying.

      On the frontend, I have worked in more than 7 projects with VueJS and also, I used to work for a company dedicated to developing e-commerce stores with Shopify, where performance and detailing it’s a big deal, so I implemented an online store having in mind different ways to perform SEO and it helps to improve my design development with BEM (Block Element Modifier) architecture.

      On NodeJS I worked mainly on two projects, one of which was an internal application for the first company I used to work for. There we had a platform to register the working time, here we had a NoSQL database in Mongo DB. company I used to work for. There we had a platform to register the working time. Also, with NodeJS I developed a personal project for educational purposes where we can have a searcher from youtube, and get the music directly. Here I learned about streaming in Node JS. And right now in order to continue learning I'm refactoring that application by applying architecture patterns,  design patterns, TypeScript, and testing with JEST usign TDD approach.
      For the other hand, as my main language was PHP, I used to work with Laravel, which is a framework, that provides by itself a big architecture where I learned how to write clean code, usign design patterns, microservices and others architecture patterns.
